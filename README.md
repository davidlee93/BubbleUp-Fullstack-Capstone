# bubbleUP

Thinkful's (https://www.thinkful.com/) Fullstack Capstone Project - A web app using Node and Express to create a backend that serves your static files and a REST API.

## Introduction
bubbleUP allows you to create bubbles that become a part of your collection of stories, memories and moments in life you want to be reminded of. You simply need to enter in the title, tag, and content of your bubble. These bubbles can be reminders, fond memories, youtube videos, or maybe even quotes you'd want to remember or have bubble up in your mind as you revisit these bubbles.

Why is this web app useful? A typical user will have many things in life that are forgotten or remain in his or her mind without being triggered for quite some time. bubbleUp allows for the user to record and be reminded of such realities.
## Client-side

There is a simple, single page given to the user to personalize his/her app. The "+" button is for creating a bubble. And the filter input is used to filter through your bubbles by the tags given to each bubble. You may also edit each bubble by clicking the edit button on each bubble and delete the bubble via the edit modal.

The app was designed to work on mobile as well as tablet and desktop from the outset.
